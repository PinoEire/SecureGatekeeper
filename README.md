# SecureGatekeeper
In this project, we offer the implementation sample of my Secure Gatekeeper, first conceived as a mix of a few design patterns, that taken individually, did not satisfy my securityrequirements. Having put the algorithm in the public domain years ago, We decided that it is worth to make available also some implementation samples that one can even use directly, thus, this repository.
